Dual Pane
=========

This plugin is designed to provide an activity module that will allow a course creator to create a
number of steps or instructions for a student to follow with links to websites in the left pane
that will load in the right pane.

User Interface

2. There are then a number of fields outside the standard module fields these are:

i. Start URL

This is the URL that the end user will start with by clicking teh first link availabel called start
by clicking this link

ii. Steps

Each step has two components:

a. A title - This is where the course creator can assign a title to give a step.

b. Step Instructions - These are the instructions that the student will follow this option allows
the course creator to use html though for link to function correctly the format should be [[URL]]
or [[URL TITLE]].
